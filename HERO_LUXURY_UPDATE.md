# Hero Section - Luxury Update Complete ✨

## Summary
Completely redesigned the Hero section with a clean, minimalist luxury aesthetic that's fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Complex Components
- **Deleted**: 3D Artist Palette component (heavy performance impact)
- **Deleted**: 3D Artwork component (complex, unnecessary)
- **Deleted**: ScreenshotDetection wrapper (not needed for hero)

- **Removed**: All colorful floating elements

### Why These Changes?
1. **Performance**: 3D components were heavy and slow to load
