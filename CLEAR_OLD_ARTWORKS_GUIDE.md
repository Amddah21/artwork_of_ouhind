# üóëÔ∏è Clear Old Artworks - Complete Guide

## üéØ **Problem:**

You're seeing old static artworks in your gallery that you didn't add through the admin dashboard. These are placeholder images that need to be removed so only your real artworks appear.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution: Clear All Old Artworks**

I've added a **"Effacer tout"** (Clear All) button to your admin dashboard that will remove all old artworks and let you start fresh with only your new artworks.

### **Method 1: Use Admin Dashboard Button (Recommended)**

1. **Go to admin dashboard** (`/admin`)
2. **Look for the red "Effacer tout" button** in the top-right corner
3. **Click the button**
4. **Confirm the action** when prompted
5. **Wait for success message** - "Galerie vid√©e"
6. **Page will reload automatically**

### **Method 2: Clear Database Directly (Advanced)**

If you want to clear the database directly:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Go to SQL Editor**
3. **Run this SQL script:**

```sql
-- Clear all artworks and images from the database
DELETE FROM artwork_images;
DELETE FROM artworks;
```

### **Method 3: Clear Local Storage (Development)**

If you're using local storage fallback:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Run this command:**

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('artspark-artworks');
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## ‚úÖ **What Happens After Clearing:**

### **Before Clearing:**

- Gallery shows old static artworks (Abstrait, Aquarelles, Photographie, Fusain)
- These are placeholder images you didn't add
- Gallery looks cluttered with unwanted content

### **After Clearing:**

- Gallery is completely empty
- Only shows "Galerie Vide" message
- Ready for your new artworks
- Clean slate to start fresh

## üé® **Next Steps:**

### **1. Clear Old Artworks:**

- Use the "Effacer tout" button in admin dashboard
- Confirm the action
- Wait for success message

### **2. Add Your Real Artworks:**

- Go to admin dashboard (`/admin`)
- Click "Ajouter une nouvelle ≈ìuvre"
- Fill in your artwork details:
  - **Title:** Your artwork name
  - **Description:** Your artwork description
  - **Category:** Choose appropriate category
  - **Upload your real images**
- Click "Ajouter l'≈ìuvre"

### **3. Verify on Home Page:**

- Go to home page (`/`)
- Should see only your new artworks
- No more old placeholder images

## üîç **Troubleshooting:**

### **If "Effacer tout" Button Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check console** for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. **Try refreshing** the page
3. **Use Method 2** (SQL script) instead

### **If Old Artworks Still Appear:**

1. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Check if you're using the right database**

### **If Gallery Shows "Galerie Vide":**

1. **This is correct** - gallery is now empty
2. **Add your first artwork** through admin dashboard
3. **Refresh home page** to see it

## üí° **Pro Tips:**

### **Before Clearing:**

- **Take screenshots** of any artworks you want to keep
- **Note down** any important artwork details
- **Make sure** you have your real images ready

### **After Clearing:**

- **Add artworks one by one** to test the system
- **Use descriptive titles** and categories
- **Upload high-quality images** for best results

## üéØ **Expected Result:**

- **Clean gallery** with no old artworks
- **Only your real artworks** appear
- **Professional look** without placeholder content
- **Full control** over gallery content
