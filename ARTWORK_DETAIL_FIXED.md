# ✅ Artwork Detail Page Fixed!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified:**

When clicking on an artwork in the gallery, it was showing **wrong artwork details** instead of the correct one you clicked on.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The `ArtworkDetail` component was using **hardcoded static data** instead of fetching the real artwork from your database through the `ArtworkContext`.

## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. ArtworkDetail Component Updated:**

- **Removed static data** - No more hardcoded artworks
- **Added real data fetching** - Now uses `useArtwork()` context
- **Proper artwork lookup** - Finds artwork by ID from your database
- **Loading states** - Shows spinner while loading
- **Error handling** - Redirects to gallery if artwork not found
- **Multiple images support** - Shows all images for an artwork
- **View counting** - Increments views when viewing artwork

### **2. Portfolio Component Fixed:**

- **Field name compatibility** - Fixed `artwork.medium` → `artwork.technique`
- **Field name compatibility** - Fixed `artwork.dimensions` → `artwork.size`
- **Fallback values** - Shows "Non spécifié" if data missing

### **3. Data Flow Now Correct:**

```
Gallery Click → Portfolio → ArtworkDetail → Real Database Data
```

## ✅ **What This Fixes:**

- **Correct artwork details** - Shows the artwork you actually clicked
- **Real data display** - All information comes from your database
- **Multiple images** - Shows all images for artworks with multiple photos
- **Proper navigation** - Clicking artwork shows correct details
- **View tracking** - Counts views correctly
- **Loading experience** - Smooth loading with spinner

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

1. **Click artwork** in gallery
2. **Portfolio component** navigates to `/artwork/{id}`
3. **ArtworkDetail component** finds artwork by ID in context
4. **Shows correct data** - Title, images, details, etc.
5. **Increments views** - Tracks popularity
6. **Multiple images** - Shows all photos if available

## 💡 **Technical Changes:**

### **Before (Broken):**

```typescript
// Static hardcoded data
const getArtworkData = (artworkId: string) => {
  const artworks = { '1': {...}, '7': {...} };
  return artworks[artworkId] || artworks['1']; // Always showed wrong data
};
```

### **After (Fixed):**

```typescript
// Real data from context
const { artworks } = useArtwork();
const foundArtwork = artworks.find((art) => art.id === id);
// Shows correct artwork data
```

---

**Now when you click on an artwork, it will show the CORRECT details!** ✅🎨

The artwork detail page now properly displays the artwork you clicked on, with all the real data from your database.
