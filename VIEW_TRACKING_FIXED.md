# üîç View Tracking System - Fixed & Enhanced

## ‚úÖ **What Was Fixed**

The view tracking system has been completely overhauled to show **real, accurate view counts** instead of static numbers.

### üéØ **Key Improvements**

1. **Session-Based Tracking** - Prevents duplicate views from the same user session
2. **Real-Time Updates** - View counts update immediately when viewing artwork
3. **Database Integration** - Uses Supabase RPC function for accurate counting
4. **Fallback System** - Works with localStorage when Supabase is not configured
5. **Admin Controls** - Reset views functionality for testing

## üîß **How It Works**

### **View Increment Process**

1. **Session Check** - Checks if artwork was already viewed in current session
2. **Database Update** - Calls `increment_views` RPC function in Supabase
3. **Local Update** - Updates local state immediately for better UX
4. **Refresh** - Refreshes from database after 1 second for accuracy

### **Session Storage**

- Uses `sessionStorage` to track viewed artworks
- Key format: `artwork_viewed_{artwork_id}`
- Prevents multiple increments from same user session
- Cleared when browser session ends

## üéÆ **Testing the View System**

### **Method 1: Normal Testing**

1. **Open Gallery** - Go to home page
2. **Click Artwork** - Click on any artwork to view details
3. **Check View Count** - Look at the "125 vues" badge
4. **Refresh Page** - Go back to gallery and click same artwork
5. **Expected Result** - View count should NOT increase (same session)

### **Method 2: New Session Testing**

1. **Open Incognito Window** - New browser session
2. **View Artwork** - Click on artwork
3. **Check Count** - View count should increase by 1
4. **Repeat** - Open another incognito window and repeat

### **Method 3: Admin Dashboard Testing**

1. **Login as Admin** - Use admin credentials
2. **Go to Dashboard** - Access admin panel
3. **Check Stats** - Look at "Total Vues" card
4. **View Artwork List** - See individual view counts
5. **Reset Views** - Click "Reset Vues" button to test

## üõ†Ô∏è **Admin Dashboard Features**

### **New Controls**

- **Reset Vues Button** - Resets all view counts to 0
- **Total Vues Card** - Shows sum of all artwork views
- **Individual View Counts** - Each artwork shows its view count

### **Reset Views Process**

1. **Click "Reset Vues"** - Orange button in admin dashboard
2. **Confirm Action** - Click "OK" in confirmation dialog
3. **View Counts Reset** - All artworks show 0 views
4. **Session Cleared** - Allows new views to be counted

## üìä **View Count Display**

### **Artwork Detail Page**

- Shows current view count in badge format
- Updates immediately when viewed
- Format: "X vues" (e.g., "125 vues")

### **Admin Dashboard**

- **Total Views Card** - Sum of all artwork views
- **Individual Counts** - Each artwork shows its view count
- **Real-time Updates** - Counts update as users view artworks

## üîç **Debugging View Issues**

### **Check Console Logs**

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

```
View incremented in database for artwork {id}
View incremented locally for artwork {id}
Artwork {id} already viewed in this session, skipping view increment
```

### **Check Session Storage**

1. **Open DevTools** - F12
2. **Go to Application Tab** - Storage section
3. **Check Session Storage** - Look for `artwork_viewed_` keys
4. **Clear if Needed** - Delete keys to allow new views

### **Check Database**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Open Table Editor** - artworks table
3. **Check Views Column** - Should show current counts
4. **Run SQL** - `SELECT id, title, views FROM artworks ORDER BY views DESC;`

## üöÄ **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Reset All Views**

1. Login as admin
2. Click "Reset Vues" button
3. Confirm action
4. All view counts should be 0

### **Step 2: Test View Increment**

1. Open gallery in normal browser
2. Click on an artwork
3. Check view count (should be 1)
4. Go back and click same artwork
5. View count should still be 1 (same session)

### **Step 3: Test New Session**

1. Open incognito window
2. Click on same artwork
3. View count should increase to 2
4. Repeat with another incognito window

### **Step 4: Verify in Admin Dashboard**

1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Check "Total Vues" card
3. Check individual artwork view counts
4. Numbers should match what you saw

## üéØ **Expected Results**

- **First View** - Count increases by 1
- **Same Session** - Count stays same
- **New Session** - Count increases by 1
- **Admin Reset** - All counts go to 0
- **Real-time Updates** - Counts update immediately

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Views Not Incrementing**

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Check if artwork exists in database
4. Try resetting views and testing again

### **Views Incrementing Multiple Times**

1. Check session storage
2. Clear browser session storage
3. Verify session-based tracking is working

### **Views Not Showing in Admin Dashboard**

1. Refresh admin dashboard
2. Check if artworks are loaded
3. Verify view counts in database

## üìà **Performance Notes**

- **Immediate Updates** - Local state updates instantly
- **Database Sync** - Refreshes from database after 1 second
- **Session Tracking** - Lightweight session storage usage
- **Fallback Support** - Works without Supabase connection

**The view tracking system now provides accurate, real-time view counts that reflect actual user engagement with your artworks!** üé®‚ú®
